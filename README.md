## The reason for my decision to do this project?

Nowadays every women mostly shop online , it's more easy , you just need to scroll in the web and pick your clothes.
I decided that I wan't to do it my self.
In my store I store all the clothes in the database and to every cloth there is diffrent sizes and diffrent quantity from any size.
I also save the users and there cart and there favorites and even there orders if they order some clothes. :briefcase:

## Technology
#### Client side :
 The client side is written in React.
 I chose React because it's rendered to the screen on every change of the state, like when you add clothes to your cart or when you log in or order things.

 
 #### Server side :
The server side is written in Typescript and compiled into JS by a gulp file.
 
 #### Database :
 The database store in PostgreSql.
 I chose this database becacuse I wanted to store my data in tables because I use foreign key in my database and I don't just save objects.
 
 ## How to run the project
 1. git clone
 2. npm ci
 3. In one terminal run :'npm run server'
 4. In other terminal run : 'npm run start'
