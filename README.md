A clothes store for women :dress: men :necktie: kids :shirt: and plus size :womans_clothes:.

## The reason for my decision to do this project?

Nowadays every women mostly shop online. It's easier , you just need to scroll on the web page and pick your clothes.
I decided that I want to do it myself.
In my store I store all the clothes in the database and for every clothes there are different sizes and quantity.
I also save the users, their cart, their favorites and even their orders if they order some clothes. :briefcase:

## Technology
#### Client side :
 The client side is written in React.
 I chose "React" because it's rendered to the screen on every change of the state, like when you add clothes to your cart or when you login or order things.
 
 #### Server side :
The server side is written in TypeScript and compiled into JS by a gulp file.
 
 #### Database :
 The database is stored in PostgreSql.
 I chose this database becaucse I wanted to store my data in tables. I also use foreign key in my database and I don't just save objects.
 
 ## How to run the project
 1. git clone
 2. npm ci
 3. In one terminal run :'npm run server'
 4. In other terminal run : 'npm run start'
