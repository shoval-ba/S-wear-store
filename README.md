## Why I chose to do this project?

Like almost every women I really like shoppping online , it's more easy , you just need to scroll in the web and pick your clothes.
I decided that I wan't to do it my self.
In my store I store all the clothes in the database and to every cloth there is diffrent sizes and diffrent quantity from any size.
I also save the users and there cart and there favorites and even there orders if they order some clothes. 

## Technology
#### Client side :
 The client size written in React app.
 I chose React because it's render to the screen in every change of the state , like when you add clothes to your cart or when you login or order things.
 
 #### Server side :
 The server size written in TypeScirpt.
 
 #### Datebase :
 The database store in PostgreSql.
 I chose this database becacuse I wanted to store my data in tables because I use foreign key in my database and I don't just save objects.
 
 ## How to run the project
 1. gin clone
 2. npm ci
 3. In one terminal run :npm run server
 4. In other terminal run : npm run start
