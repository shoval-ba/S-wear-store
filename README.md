## Why I choose this specific project?

Online shopping became extremely popular in the last decade and especially in the last 2 years since Covid-19 emerge and changed our shopping habits.
Nowadays, everyone can easily order anything online so I decided to make a fashionable clothing website that is convenient for the customer to see all the offered products with different sizes and quantities to choose from and easily make an order.
As for the technical part, as part of building the website, I stored all the offered products in a Database as well as the userâ€™s info, including their cart, whishing list and previous orders. :briefcase:

## Technology
#### Client side :
 The client side is written in React.
 I chose "React" because it's rendered to the screen on every change of the state, like when you add clothes to your cart or when you login or order things.
 
 #### Server side :
The server side is written in TypeScript and compiled into JS through a gulp file.
 
 #### Database :
 The database is stored in PostgreSql.
 I chose this database becaucse I wanted to store my data in tables. I also use foreign key in my database and I don't just save objects.
 
 ## How to run the project 
 1. git clone
 2. npm ci
 3. In one terminal run :'npm run server'
 4. In other terminal run : 'npm run start'
